| **Technical Compliance** | Meets technical specifications | 30-40% |
| **Price Competitiveness** | Reasonable and competitive pricing | 20-30% |
| **Company Experience** | Relevant past projects and qualifications | 20-25% |
| **Timeline Feasibility** | Realistic delivery schedule | 10-15% |
| **Risk Assessment** | Overall risk level (lower = better) | 10-15% |

**‚öñÔ∏è Weight Guidelines:**
- Weights must sum to exactly 100%
- Adjust based on project priorities
- Technical projects: Higher technical weight
- Budget-sensitive projects: Higher price weight

### **Step 3: Running Analysis**

#### **Streamlit Interface**
1. Click "Analyze Proposals" button
2. Watch progress bar (30-60 seconds per proposal)
3. Review analysis results
4. Check for any error messages

#### **Google Colab Interface**
1. Run Cell 10: "Execute AI Analysis"
2. Wait for completion (5-8 minutes per proposal)
3. Review results in subsequent cells

### **Step 4: Interpreting Results**

#### **Rankings Table**
- **Rank**: Position based on weighted score
- **Supplier**: Company name
- **Final Score**: Overall weighted score (0-100)
- **Individual Scores**: Scores for each criterion

#### **Detailed Analysis**
Click "View Details" for each supplier to see:
- **Justification**: AI explanation for each score
- **Evidence**: Key quotes from the proposal
- **Red Flags**: Potential issues or concerns
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improvement

#### **Score Interpretation**
- **90-100**: Excellent (Highly recommended)
- **80-89**: Good (Recommended with minor concerns)
- **70-79**: Fair (Acceptable with conditions)
- **60-69**: Poor (Not recommended without major improvements)
- **Below 60**: Very Poor (Not recommended)

### **Step 5: Exporting Results**

#### **Excel Export**
- Click "Download Excel Report" button
- File includes:
  - Summary statistics
  - Detailed rankings
  - Individual criterion scores
  - Justifications and evidence
  - Timestamp and metadata

#### **JSON Export (Colab)**
- Run the export cell in Colab
- Download the JSON file for programmatic use

## üìä **Understanding the Analysis**

### **Technical Compliance Analysis**
The AI evaluates how well each proposal meets the technical requirements:
- **Specification Adherence**: Does it meet all technical specs?
- **Technical Approach**: Is the proposed solution sound?
- **Innovation**: Are there beneficial technical improvements?
- **Completeness**: Are all technical aspects addressed?

### **Price Competitiveness Analysis**
The AI assesses pricing reasonableness:
- **Market Comparison**: How does pricing compare to market rates?
- **Value Proposition**: Is the price justified by the offering?
- **Cost Breakdown**: Are costs transparent and reasonable?
- **Budget Alignment**: Does it fit within budget constraints?

### **Company Experience Analysis**
The AI evaluates supplier qualifications:
- **Relevant Projects**: Past experience with similar projects
- **Team Qualifications**: Expertise of key personnel
- **Company Track Record**: Success with previous clients
- **Certifications**: Relevant industry certifications

### **Timeline Feasibility Analysis**
The AI assesses project schedule realism:
- **Realistic Milestones**: Are deadlines achievable?
- **Resource Allocation**: Adequate resources for timeline?
- **Risk Factors**: Potential schedule delays identified?
- **Critical Path**: Understanding of project dependencies

### **Risk Assessment Analysis**
The AI identifies potential project risks:
- **Technical Risks**: Technology or implementation challenges
